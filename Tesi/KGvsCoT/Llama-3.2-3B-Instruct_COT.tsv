The phrase ""trying to kill him"" suggests an action that is aggressive and violent. Among the given options, ""accelerate"" is the only one that implies a violent or aggressive action, as it suggests increasing the speed of something to cause harm.

Let's reason step-by-step. The context of the question is that the man is trying to escape from a cat, and the cat is trying to kill him.

To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of a place that is hot and arid. Hot and arid places are typically associated with dry conditions, limited vegetation, and high temperatures. Among the given choices, ""sandy"" is a common feature of hot and arid places, as sand dunes are often found in these regions.

"	"[': Professors are typically educators who work in academic institutions, and their primary role is to impart knowledge to students. This involves preparing and delivering lectures, grading assignments, and providing guidance to students. While some professors may specialize in a particular subject, such as physics, and may wear traditional attire like tweed jackets, these are not the primary functions of a professor. Professors do not ""master"" a subject in the sense of being experts, nor do they ""school"" students, which is a term more commonly associated with educating children. The correct answer is the one that aligns with the primary function of a professor.\n\n', ' E.']"	"["":\nLet's reason step-by-step.  'Master physics' is a specific subject, and while professors may be experts in physics, it is not a general description of what professors do. 'State facts' is not a typical activity of professors, as they are more focused on conveying knowledge and ideas rather than simply stating facts. 'Wear wrinkled tweed jackets' is a stereotype about professors, but it is not a primary function of their job. 'School students' is the opposite of what professors do, as they are educators, not students. 'Teach courses' is a general description of the primary activity of professors, as they are responsible for instructing and guiding students in various subjects.\n"", '\nE']"

- A foreword is an introduction to a book, often written by someone other than the author.
- The question asks what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword, so we can exclude options that are directly related to forewords (A and D).
- An afterword is similar to a foreword, but it is written by the author, so it's also not what we're looking for (D).
- An epilogue is a section that provides a conclusion or a final thought, but it's not typically found in the main body of the book, so it's a possible candidate (E).
- IKEA instructions are unrelated to the context of a book, so we can exclude option C.
- A conclusion is a section that summarizes the main points of a book, which is a common feature in many books, not just those without a foreword (B).

To answer this question, we need to consider the context in which a grape is being fed to someone else. Typically, grapes are consumed as a food item, and it's unlikely that someone would feed grapes to another person in a field or a painting. The bathroom is also an unlikely location, as it's not a typical place for feeding food to others. Between Michigan and Minnesota, neither of these locations is directly related to the act of feeding grapes to someone else. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that a grape is being fed to someone else in a setting where food is typically prepared and consumed, such as a kitchen or dining area, which is not listed among the options. However, since we have to choose from the given options, we can eliminate the geographical locations and the bathroom, leaving us with the painting, which is also an unlikely location. Since none of the options seem to fit perfectly, we can consider the context of the question and the fact that grapes are often fed to animals, but that's not an option. The closest option that might fit the context of feeding grapes to someone else (in a more figurative or humorous sense) would be in a setting where grapes are being used as a prop or decoration, such as a painting. However, this is a bit of a stretch.

"	A	E	":
Let's reason step-by-step.  A grape is a type of fruit, and it is unlikely to be found in a field (A) as it is not a plant. 'Bathroom' (B) is also unlikely as grapes are not typically fed to people in bathrooms. 'Michigan' (C) and 'Minnesota' (D) are states, and it's unlikely that a grape would be being fed to someone in a geographical location. 'Painting' (E) is a plausible option, as grapes are often used as a food source for animals, and a painting might be a temporary enclosure or a feeding area for a pet, such as a bird or a small mammal.

The context of the question is a holy site, which typically evokes feelings of reverence and spirituality. The presence of people crying suggests an emotional response, likely due to a significant or meaningful event. The tour guide's explanation is likely to be related to the emotional significance of the site. Given the options, ""common"" is the most plausible explanation, as it suggests that the crying is a natural response to a shared experience or a common human emotion, rather than something unusual or unrelated (like ""profane"" or ""damaged"").
