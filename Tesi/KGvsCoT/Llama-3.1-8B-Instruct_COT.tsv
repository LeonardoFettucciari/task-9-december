Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that there is a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats. A mezzanine is a raised platform or balcony that is often found in large public spaces such as theaters and concert halls. It is used to increase the seating capacity of the space. Given this information, it is likely that James works in a place where there is an auditorium with a mezzanine. A theater or a concert hall would be a good fit for this description. 'Floors' is not a good fit since it is a general term for the levels of a building, and does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or mezzanine. 'Education' and'school' are also not good fits since they are general terms for institutions that provide education, and do not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or mezzanine.

'Lifeless' is a term that describes a place or thing that lacks life or vitality, which could be a consequence of a hot and arid environment, but it's not a description of the environment itself.
