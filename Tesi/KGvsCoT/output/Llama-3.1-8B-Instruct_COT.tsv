2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"accelerate

The action of the person in the car would be to try and catch up to the man or block his escape, which would involve increasing their speed. 

"	A	A	" 
Let's reason step-by-step. The man is trying to break the glass to escape, but he can't. This implies that the glass is being held or blocked by something. The person in the cat is likely a cat, and cats are known to block or pounce on things to catch their prey. In this context, the cat is likely blocking the man's escape by sitting on the glass. The verb that best describes the cat's action is'sit', but it is not among the options. However,'sit' is closely related to 'accelerate' in the sense that a cat may accelerate its weight to block the man's escape. 'Putting together', 'working', 'construct' and 'train' do not make sense in this context.

These types of buildings often have auditoriums with seating areas, and a mezzanine can be used to increase the capacity of the space. This suggests that James works in a building that is designed for performances or events, which is more likely to be a theater or a concert hall.

"	C	A	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that there is a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats. A mezzanine is a raised platform or balcony that is often found in large public spaces such as theaters and concert halls. It is used to increase the seating capacity of the space. Given this information, it is likely that James works in a place where there is an auditorium with a mezzanine. A theater or a concert hall would be a good fit for this description. 'Floors' is not a good fit since it is a general term for the levels of a building, and does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or mezzanine. 'Education' and'school' are also not good fits since they are general terms for institutions that provide education, and do not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or mezzanine.

'Lifeless' is a term that describes a place with little or no life, which could be true for a hot and arid place, but it is not a specific type of place.

'Neutral' is a term that describes something as not having a strong or unpleasant quality, which does not necessarily relate to the physical characteristics of a place.

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people crying at a holy site. The tour guide is explaining why this is happening. 'Profane' means something that is not holy, which doesn't make sense in this context since the site is holy. 'Halibut' is a type of fish and has nothing to do with people crying at a holy site. 'Damaged' could be a reason for people crying, but it's not the most likely explanation in this context. 'Common' means something that is usual or ordinary, which is a good fit for the situation. People crying at a holy site is a common reaction, especially if it's a site with a sad or emotional history.
