A. Accelerate - This doesn't fit the context of the scenario.

D. Construct - This implies building something, which isn't applicable here.
E. Train - This could imply training a cat, but it's not directly relevant to the scenario.

People living in a farmhouse often work on the farm, tending to crops, animals, or machinery."	"A heifer is a young female cow. The term ""master"" typically refers to a person who owns or has authority over an animal, which usually means a farmer or rancher.
