2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	B	A	A	B	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	"1) The context is about someone trying to escape from a dangerous situation. 2) The man was attempting to break glass to escape, but failed. 3) There's another person referred to as ""the person in the cat,"" which likely means they were in a cat burglar or similar position, trying to catch or harm the escaping man. 4) Given this setup, the action that makes sense for the person trying to prevent the escape would be to hinder or impede the escape attempt.

Looking at the options:
A. Accelerate - This doesn't fit the context.
B. Putting together - This could imply assembling something to block the escape, which fits the context.
C. Working - This is too vague and doesn't specify an action.
D. Construct - Similar to B, this could mean building something to block the escape.
E. Train - This doesn't fit the context of preventing an escape.

Both B and D are plausible, but ""putting together"" (B) is more immediate and specific to the action of blocking the escape.

Answer: B"	" The context involves someone trying to escape by breaking glass, but failing, and another person (in a cat) attempting to harm the first person. The action of the second person is implied to be contrary to escaping, suggesting an action that would hinder the escape. Among the options, ""accelerate"" could metaphorically refer to speeding up the situation to catch the person, ""putting together"" could mean assembling something to block the escape route, ""working"" and ""construct"" are vague and don't clearly relate to hindering an escape, and ""train"" doesn't fit the context.

1272e693cf9152e7ac71095c643676b5	In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work?	"A. theater
B. floors
C. concert hall
D. education
E. school"	A	A	A	C	A	A	A	"Movie theaters show films on large screens, and people usually sit in rows of seats to watch.
The seating in a concert hall is arranged to provide optimal views and sound for the audience."	"1. The question mentions a ""building"" where James works. 2. It specifies that there is a ""small mezzanine in the auditorium."" 3. A mezzanine is a small floor between two larger ones, often used to add extra seating or space. 4. An auditorium is typically found in places like theaters, concert halls, and sometimes schools for large gatherings or performances.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A. Theater - This fits well as theaters often have auditoriums with mezzanines for additional seating.
B. Floors - This doesn't make sense in this context as it's not a place one would work.
C. Concert hall - Similar to a theater, concert halls also have auditoriums with mezzanines.
D. Education - While educational buildings can have auditoriums, they don't typically have mezzanines specifically for seating.
E. School - Schools can have auditoriums but usually don't have mezzanines for seating.

Considering the specific mention of a mezzanine for seats, the most fitting option is a theater or concert hall.

Answer: A"	" A mezzanine is a small floor between two other floors, often used to create additional space. In the context of the question, the building has an auditorium with a small mezzanine added to accommodate more seats. This description fits a theater best, as theaters frequently use mezzanines to maximize seating capacity. Concert halls, while similar, typically do not use the term ""mezzanine"" as commonly as theaters do. Schools and educational institutions (option D) usually do not require the specific addition of a mezzanine for seating purposes.
