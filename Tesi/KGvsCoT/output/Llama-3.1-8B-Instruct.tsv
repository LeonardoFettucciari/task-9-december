2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	A	D	E	A	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	" 

1. The man is trying to break the glass to escape, which implies he is being pursued or threatened by someone or something.
2. The phrase ""the person in the cat"" is likely a metaphor or a figure of speech, as it doesn't make literal sense for a person to be inside a cat.
3. Given the context of the man trying to escape, it's likely that the person in the cat is the pursuer or the one trying to harm the man.
4. The phrase ""trying to kill him"" further supports the idea that the person in the cat is the aggressor.
5. Considering the options provided, the most likely action for the person in the cat to take, given that they are trying to harm or kill the man, would be to accelerate their pursuit or attack.

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. 'Before noon' and 'before lunch' are both before the afternoon, so they don't make sense here. 'Morning' is also before the afternoon, so it doesn't make sense. 'Christmas' is not completely wrong since with the passing of time, eventually Christmas may come, but the question seems to suggest the scope of a single day, hence 'evening' is more likely than 'christmas'.

1272e693cf9152e7ac71095c643676b5	In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work?	"A. theater
B. floors
C. concert hall
D. education
E. school"	A	A	A	C	D	E	A	"Movie theaters show films on large screens, and people usually sit in rows of seats to watch.
The seating in a concert hall is arranged to provide optimal views and sound for the audience."	" 

1. The question mentions a ""small mezzanine in the auditorium."" 
2. A mezzanine is a raised platform or balcony in a building, often used to increase the seating capacity of a room.
3. An auditorium is a large room used for performances, presentations, or lectures.
4. Given the presence of a mezzanine in the auditorium, it suggests that the building is designed for performances or presentations, which is typical of a theater or a concert hall.

Considering the options:

- A. theater: This is a likely option, as theaters often have auditoriums with mezzanines to increase seating capacity.
- B. floors: This option is not relevant, as the question is asking about the type of building, not the type of floor.
- C. concert hall: This is also a likely option, as concert halls often have large auditoriums with mezzanines.
- D. education: While some educational institutions may have auditoriums, the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in educational settings as it is in performance venues.
- E. school: This option is similar to D. education, and the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in schools as it is in performance venues.

Based on the reasoning, the most likely options are A. theater and C. concert hall. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose the one that is more directly related to the presence of an auditorium with a mezzanine.

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. 'Before noon' and 'before lunch' are both before the afternoon, so they don't make sense here. 'Morning' is also before the afternoon, so it doesn't make sense. 'Christmas' is not completely wrong since with the passing of time, eventually Christmas may come, but the question seems to suggest the scope of a single day, hence 'evening' is more likely than 'christmas'.

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. 'Before noon' and 'before lunch' are both before the afternoon, so they don't make sense here. 'Morning' is also before the afternoon, so it doesn't make sense. 'Christmas' is not completely wrong since with the passing of time, eventually Christmas may come, but the question seems to suggest the scope of a single day, hence 'evening' is more likely than 'christmas'.

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. 'Before noon' and 'before lunch' are both before the afternoon, so they don't make sense here. 'Morning' is also before the afternoon, so it doesn't make sense. 'Christmas' is not completely wrong since with the passing of time, eventually Christmas may come, but the question seems to suggest the scope of a single day, hence 'evening' is more likely than 'christmas'.

c640116ca6905d5256edadb616b3f76e	Noble citizen of the Roman empire believed those born with lower status were what to them?	"A. loser
B. ignoble
C. peasant
D. inferior
E. plebeian"	D	D	D	D	D	E	A	"People may refer to others as ""losers"" when they believe that person is unsuccessful or lacks social status.
In a social setting, someone might be labeled a ""loser"" if they don't fit in, are socially awkward, or lack the traits valued by the group.
In many cultures, peasants were considered part of the lower social class, with limited access to education or resources.
If something is considered inferior, it is often viewed as lower in quality compared to something else.
In a hierarchy, an inferior position may be one with less authority or fewer responsibilities.
The term ""plebeian"" originally referred to the common people in ancient Rome, distinct from the aristocratic patricians."	" 

1. The question is asking about the Roman Empire, specifically the views of its citizens on people born with lower status.
2. The term ""noble"" suggests a sense of superiority or high social standing.
3. In the Roman Empire, people were often categorized into different social classes, with the nobles at the top and the lower classes below them.
4. The term ""ignoble"" (B) means not noble or of low birth, which fits with the idea of people being born with lower status.
5. The term ""loser"" (A) is a more modern concept and not typically used in ancient Roman society.
6. The term ""peasant"" (C) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.
7. The term ""inferior"" (D) is a general term that could apply, but it's not as specific to the Roman context as ""ignoble"".
8. The term ""plebeian"" (E) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is the term that best describes people born with lower status in the Roman Empire.

'Morning' is also before the afternoon, so it doesn't make sense. 'Christmas' is not completely wrong since with the passing of time, eventually Christmas may come, but the question seems to suggest the scope of a single day, hence 'evening' is more likely than 'christmas'.

1. The question asks for a location where you can find only a few offices. This implies a small number of offices, not a large number.
2. A skyscraper (A) typically has many offices, so it's unlikely to have only a few.
3. New York (B) is a city, and cities usually have many offices, so this is also unlikely.
4. A school building (C) might have a few offices, such as the principal's office or administrative offices, but it's not primarily an office building.
5. A city (D) has many offices, so this is unlikely.
6. Work (E) is a general term that could refer to any location where people work, but it's not a specific location where you can find only a few offices.

Considering these options, the most likely location where you can find only a few offices is a school building, as it's a smaller structure that might have a few administrative offices.

B. conclusion
C. ikea instructions
D. afterword
E. epilogue"	E	D	D	A	D	E	A	"In written communication, the last word can leave a lasting impression on the reader.
An afterword is a section in a book that appears at the end, typically written by the author or another contributor.
An epilogue is often included at the end of a book, play, or movie."	" 

1. A foreword is typically written by someone other than the author of the book, often an expert or someone with a relevant connection to the topic. It provides an introduction to the book and its content.

2. We are looking for something that is not a foreword. This means we need to consider other parts of a book that serve a similar purpose or provide additional information.

3. A conclusion (B) is a summary of the main points discussed in the book, often found at the end. It's not a foreword, but it's not the only option that fits the description.

4. IKEA instructions (C) are not typically found in books, especially not in non-fiction or fiction novels. This option seems out of place.

5. An afterword (D) is similar to a foreword but is usually written by the author themselves. It provides additional information or insights that may not have been included in the main text.

6. An epilogue (E) is a section that provides a conclusion or a final thought on the story or topic. It's often found at the end of a book, similar to a conclusion.

Considering the options, the most likely thing to be found in a book that is not a foreword is a conclusion or an epilogue. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we need to choose the best option. Between B and E, an epilogue (E) is more specific to fiction books and provides a conclusion to the story, making it a more fitting choice.
