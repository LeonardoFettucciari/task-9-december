1. The man is trying to break the glass to escape, which implies he is being pursued or threatened by someone or something.
2. The phrase ""the person in the cat"" is likely a metaphor or a figure of speech, as it doesn't make literal sense for a person to be inside a cat.
3. Given the context of the man trying to escape, it's likely that the person in the cat is the pursuer or the one trying to harm the man.
4. The phrase ""trying to kill him"" further supports the idea that the person in the cat is the aggressor.
5. Considering the options provided, the most likely action for the person in the cat to take, given that they are trying to harm or kill the man, would be to accelerate their pursuit or attack.

Answer: A"	"

B. floors
C. concert hall
D. education
E. school"	A	A	A	C	E	A	C	Movie theaters show films on large screens, and people usually sit in rows of seats to watch.	" 

1. The question mentions a ""small mezzanine in the auditorium."" 
2. A mezzanine is a raised platform or balcony in a building, often used to increase the seating capacity of a room.
3. An auditorium is a large room used for performances, presentations, or lectures.
4. Given the presence of a mezzanine in the auditorium, it suggests that the building is designed for performances or presentations, which is typical of a theater or a concert hall.

Considering the options:

- A. theater: This is a likely option, as theaters often have auditoriums with mezzanines to increase seating capacity.
- B. floors: This option is not relevant, as the question is asking about the type of building, not the type of floor.
- C. concert hall: This is also a likely option, as concert halls often have large auditoriums with mezzanines.
- D. education: While some educational institutions may have auditoriums, the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in educational settings as it is in performance venues.
- E. school: This option is similar to D. education, and the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in schools as it is in performance venues.

Based on the reasoning, the most likely options are A. theater and C. concert hall. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose the one that is more directly related to the presence of an auditorium with a mezzanine.

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that there is a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.

'floors' is not a valid option since it is a general term that refers to the physical surfaces of a building, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine. 'concert hall' is also a valid option since it is a place where there is an auditorium, and it is similar to a theater. 'education' is a general term that refers to the process of learning, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine.'school' is also a general term that refers to a place of education, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine.

Starting a business is a common way to make money by selling goods or services."	" 

1. The question is asking about a person's actions at work. 
2. Work is typically a place where people go to earn a living or perform tasks for a job.
3. The primary purpose of going to work is to earn money or perform tasks that contribute to the organization's goals.
4. Based on this understanding, we can eliminate options that are unrelated to work or earning a living.

B. killing
C. law suits
D. out of pocket
E. feel loved"	D	D	D	A	D	D	A		" 

1. The context of the question is about a man giving assistance to a panhandler in the streets.
2. Panhandling is a common practice where people ask for money or other forms of assistance on the streets.
3. The question asks how the man gave assistance, implying a specific action or method.
4. Considering the options provided, we can eliminate those that don't make sense in the context of giving assistance, such as ""feeling good"" (A), ""killing"" (B), and ""law suits"" (C).
5. ""Out of pocket"" (D) is a common idiomatic expression that means to pay or give money directly from one's own pocket, which is a plausible way to give assistance to a panhandler.
6. ""Feel loved"" (E) is not a direct action of giving assistance.

2. A loft (A) and an attic (B) are both areas in a house where mice might be found, especially if there are holes or gaps in the walls or roof. So, these are not ideal locations.
3. A bell cat (C) is not a location, but rather a type of cat, so we can rule this out.
4. The countryside (D) is a rural area where mice are likely to be found, especially in fields, farms, or homes. So, this is not the best choice either.
5. A laboratory (E) is a place where scientists conduct experiments, and mice are often used as test subjects in scientific research. Therefore, it's a location where mice are intentionally present and not unwanted.

In a hierarchy, an inferior position may be one with less authority or fewer responsibilities."	" 

1. The question is asking about the Roman Empire, specifically the views of its citizens on people born with lower status.
2. The term ""noble"" suggests a sense of superiority or high social standing.
3. In the Roman Empire, people were often categorized into different social classes, with the nobles at the top and the lower classes below them.

5. The term ""loser"" (A) is a more modern concept and not typically used in ancient Roman society.
6. The term ""peasant"" (C) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.
7. The term ""inferior"" (D) is a general term that could apply, but it's not as specific to the Roman context as ""ignoble"".
8. The term ""plebeian"" (E) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is the term that best describes people born with lower status in the Roman Empire.

Answer: B"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells of the Roman empire and its citizens. The Roman empire was divided into two main classes: the patricians (noble) and the plebeians (commoners). The question tells that the noble citizens of the Roman empire believed those born with lower status were inferior to them. 'loser' is a term that is not typically used in the context of the Roman empire. 'ignoble' is the opposite of noble, so it does not make sense in this context. 'peasant' is a term that is not typically used in the context of the Roman empire. 'plebeian' is a term that is used in the context of the Roman empire, but it refers to the commoners, not the lower status. 'inferior' is a term that is used to describe something that is of lower quality or status, which fits the context of the question.

Answer:
D"	 D	 D	" 

1. The question is asking about the Roman Empire, specifically the views of its citizens on people born with lower status.
2. The term ""noble"" suggests a sense of superiority or high social standing.
3. In the Roman Empire, people were often categorized into different social classes, with the nobles at the top and the lower classes below them.
4. The term ""ignoble"" (B) means not noble or of low birth, which fits with the idea of people being born with lower status.
5. The term ""loser"" (A) is a more modern concept and not typically used in ancient Roman society.
6. The term ""peasant"" (C) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.
7. The term ""inferior"" (D) is a general term that could apply, but it's not as specific to the Roman context as ""ignoble"".
8. The term ""plebeian"" (E) refers to a specific class of people in ancient Roman society, but it's not the most general term for people born with lower status.

1. The question mentions a ""small flying animal."" This suggests that the animal is likely a bird, given that birds are small and can fly.
2. The animal picks up a string. This action implies that the animal is likely using the string for a purpose, such as building a nest or creating a toy.
3. Considering the options, ""bird's nest"" (A) is a plausible destination for the string, as birds often use strings or twigs to build their nests.
4. The other options are less likely: ""park"" (B) is a general location, not a specific destination for the string; ""guitar"" (C) is an object that doesn't typically involve strings in the context of a bird; ""kite"" (D) is a toy that might involve strings, but it's not a typical destination for a bird; and ""quark"" (E) is a subatomic particle, unrelated to the context of the question.

2. It also mentions that it was the only place in town that wasn't booked solid for the week, which implies that it's a place where people stay for a period of time.
3. The mention of a carpet and drapes further supports the idea that it's a place where people stay, as these are common features found in hotel rooms or apartments.
4. Considering the options provided, a brothel (A) and a bowling alley (D) are unlikely to be the correct answer, as they don't typically have carpets and drapes, and they're not usually booked solid for the week.
5. A restaurant (B) might have carpets and drapes, but it's unlikely to be booked solid for the week, and it's not a place where people stay for an extended period.

Let's reason step-by-step.  The text tells of a place that is expensive, has a carpet and drapes, and is booked solid for the week. This suggests that the place is a place where people stay for a while, which is a hotel. A hotel is a place where people can stay for a while, and it is common for hotels to have carpets and drapes. A hotel is also a place that is often booked solid for the week, especially during peak travel seasons. A brothel, a restaurant, a building, and a bowling alley do not typically have carpets and drapes, and they are not usually booked solid for the week.

Answer:
E"	 E	 E	" 

1. The context mentions that the place was expensive, which suggests that it's a high-end establishment.
2. It also mentions that it was the only place in town that wasn't booked solid for the week, which implies that it's a place where people stay for a period of time.
3. The mention of a carpet and drapes further supports the idea that it's a place where people stay, as these are common features found in hotel rooms or apartments.
4. Considering the options provided, a brothel (A) and a bowling alley (D) are unlikely to be the correct answer, as they don't typically have carpets and drapes, and they're not usually booked solid for the week.
5. A restaurant (B) might have carpets and drapes, but it's unlikely to be booked solid for the week, and it's not a place where people stay for an extended period.
6. A building (C) is too general, as it could refer to any type of structure, and it doesn't provide enough context to determine the specific type of place being referred to.

Option C, ""pay bills,"" is a necessary part of adult life, but it's not directly related to changing one's life.

D. afterword
E. epilogue"	E	D	E	A	B	E	B	An epilogue is often included at the end of a book, play, or movie.	" 

1. A foreword is typically written by someone other than the author of the book, often an expert or someone with a relevant connection to the topic. It provides an introduction to the book and its content.

2. We are looking for something that is not a foreword. This means we need to consider other parts of a book that serve a similar purpose or provide additional information.

3. A conclusion (B) is a summary of the main points discussed in the book, often found at the end. It's not a foreword, but it's not the only option that fits the description.

4. IKEA instructions (C) are not typically found in books, especially not in non-fiction or fiction novels. This option seems out of place.

5. An afterword (D) is similar to a foreword but is usually written by the author themselves. It provides additional information or insights that may not have been included in the main text.

6. An epilogue (E) is a section that provides a conclusion or a final thought on the story or topic. It's often found at the end of a book, similar to a conclusion.

Considering the options, the most likely thing to be found in a book that is not a foreword is a conclusion or an epilogue. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we need to choose the best option. Between B and E, an epilogue (E) is more specific to fiction books and provides a conclusion to the story, making it a more fitting choice.

Answer: E"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  A 'foreword' is a part of a book that is written by someone other than the author, usually to introduce the book.

6. An epilogue (E) is a section that provides a conclusion or a final thought on the story or topic. It's often found at the end of a book, similar to a conclusion.

Considering the options, the most likely thing to be found in a book that is not a foreword is a conclusion or an epilogue. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we need to choose the best option. Between B and E, an epilogue (E) is more specific to fiction books and provides a conclusion to the story, making it a more fitting choice.

Answer: E"	 B	 E	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  A 'foreword' is a part of a book that is written by someone other than the author, usually to introduce the book. An 'afterword' is a part of a book that is written by the author, usually to conclude the book. An 'epilogue' is a part of a book that is written by the author, usually to conclude the book. A 'conclusion' is a part of a book that is written by the author, usually to conclude the book. 'Ikea instructions' is not a part of a book, it is a manual for assembling furniture. 'Last word' is not a part of a book, it is the last word of a sentence or a text. Since 'afterword', 'conclusion', 'epilogue' are all parts of a book that are written by the author, and they are not a foreword, they are all likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword.

B. building
C. kansas city
D. maine
E. falling down"	A	C	A	C	A	A	C	Texas is known for its barbecue, particularly beef brisket, and Tex-Mex cuisine.	" 

1. The question is asking about BBQ steakhouses, which implies a type of restaurant that serves both barbecue and steak.
2. We need to consider locations in the United States known for their BBQ or steak culture.
3. Texas is famous for its BBQ, but it's also known for its steakhouses, particularly in cities like Austin and Dallas.
4. Kansas City is famous for its BBQ, with a style that's distinct from other parts of the country.
5. Maine is not particularly known for its BBQ or steakhouses.
6. ""Building"" is not a location, so it can't be the correct answer.
7. ""Falling down"" is not a location either, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the question.

Considering these points, the most likely locations for famous BBQ steakhouses in America are Texas and Kansas City.

However, since the question asks for a single location, we need to choose the one that's more closely associated with both BBQ and steakhouses. Kansas City is particularly famous for its BBQ, but it's also known for its steakhouses. Texas is also famous for its BBQ, but it's not as closely associated with steakhouses as Kansas City.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question asks for the most famous BBQ steakhouses in America. BBQ is a type of food that is often associated with the Southern United States. Texas and Kansas City are both well-known for their BBQ and steakhouses. Texas is famous for its beef and BBQ, and Kansas City is famous for its BBQ and steakhouses. Maine is not typically associated with BBQ or steakhouses, as it is a coastal state with a different culinary tradition. A 'building' is a general term that could refer to any type of structure, and it is not a specific location. 'Falling down' is not a location at all, but rather a state of being. Therefore, the most likely answers are Texas and Kansas City.

1. We are looking for a place where a grape is being fed to someone else. This implies a human interaction.
2. Grapes are typically consumed as food, so it's likely that the grape is being eaten.
3. Eating grapes is a common activity, often done in a social setting or at a meal.
4. A field (A) is where grapes are typically grown, but it's not a place where grapes are being fed to someone else.
5. A bathroom (B) is not a place where grapes are typically eaten.
6. Michigan (C) and Minnesota (D) are places where grapes might be grown, but they're not specific locations where grapes are being fed to someone else.
7. A painting (E) is not a place where grapes are being eaten.

Considering these points, the most likely place where a grape is being fed to someone else is a social setting, such as a table or a restaurant.
