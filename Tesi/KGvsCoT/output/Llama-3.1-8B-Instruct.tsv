2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	A	A	A	A	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	" 

1. The man is trying to break the glass to escape, which implies he is being pursued or threatened by someone or something.
2. The phrase ""the person in the cat"" is likely a metaphor or a figure of speech, as it doesn't make literal sense for a person to be inside a cat.
3. Given the context of the man trying to escape, it's likely that the person in the cat is the pursuer or the one trying to harm the man.
4. The phrase ""trying to kill him"" further supports the idea that the person in the cat is the aggressor.
5. Considering the options provided, the most likely action for the person in the cat to take, given that they are trying to harm or kill the man, would be to accelerate their pursuit or attack.

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The man is trying to break the glass to escape, but he cannot. This implies that the glass is being held by something or someone. The person in the cat is likely a cat, and cats are known for their ability to pounce on prey. Given the context, it is likely that the cat is trying to pounce on the man. To pounce, the cat would need to accelerate its movement to quickly jump at the man.

1272e693cf9152e7ac71095c643676b5	In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work?	"A. theater
B. floors
C. concert hall
D. education
E. school"	A	A	A	C	E	C	C	"Movie theaters show films on large screens, and people usually sit in rows of seats to watch.
The seating in a concert hall is arranged to provide optimal views and sound for the audience."	" 

1. The question mentions a ""small mezzanine in the auditorium."" 
2. A mezzanine is a raised platform or balcony in a building, often used to increase the seating capacity of a room.
3. An auditorium is a large room used for performances, presentations, or lectures.
4. Given the presence of a mezzanine in the auditorium, it suggests that the building is designed for performances or presentations, which is typical of a theater or a concert hall.

Considering the options:

- A. theater: This is a likely option, as theaters often have auditoriums with mezzanines to increase seating capacity.
- B. floors: This option is not relevant, as the question is asking about the type of building, not the type of floor.
- C. concert hall: This is also a likely option, as concert halls often have large auditoriums with mezzanines.
- D. education: While some educational institutions may have auditoriums, the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in educational settings as it is in performance venues.
- E. school: This option is similar to D. education, and the presence of a mezzanine is not as typical in schools as it is in performance venues.

Based on the reasoning, the most likely options are A. theater and C. concert hall. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose the one that is more directly related to the presence of an auditorium with a mezzanine.

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that there is a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats. A mezzanine is a raised platform or floor that is often found in large public spaces like theaters and concert halls. It is used to increase the seating capacity of the space. Given this information, it is likely that James works in a place where there is an auditorium with a mezzanine. A 'theater' is a place where there is an auditorium, so it is a valid option. 'floors' is not a valid option since it is a general term that refers to the physical surfaces of a building, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine. 'concert hall' is also a valid option since it is a place where there is an auditorium, and it is similar to a theater. 'education' is a general term that refers to the process of learning, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine.'school' is also a general term that refers to a place of education, and it does not specifically relate to the presence of an auditorium or a mezzanine.

B. draw attention to themselves
C. make money
D. falling down
E. come home"	C	C	C	A	C	C	A	"People can make money by working at a job, where they receive a salary or hourly wage.
Starting a business is a common way to make money by selling goods or services."	" 

1. The question is asking about a person's actions at work. 
2. Work is typically a place where people go to earn a living or perform tasks for a job.
3. The primary purpose of going to work is to earn money or perform tasks that contribute to the organization's goals.
4. Based on this understanding, we can eliminate options that are unrelated to work or earning a living.

Options A (cross street) and E (come home) are actions that are not typically associated with work. Option D (falling down) is an action that might happen at work, but it's not a typical or expected action. Option B (draw attention to themselves) might be a part of some jobs, but it's not a universal action that people do at work.

Option C (make money) is the most relevant choice, as it aligns with the primary purpose of going to work.

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  'cross street' is something you do when you are walking, not when you are at work. 'draw attention to themselves' is something you do when you want to be noticed, but it is not a common task at work. 'falling down' is something you do when you lose your balance, it is not a task at work. 'come home' is something you do when you are done with work, it is not something you do at work.'make money' is a common task at work, since most people work to earn money.
