2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	E	E	A	E	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	" 

The question mentions a man trying to break a glass to escape, but he fails. It also mentions a person in a cat trying to kill him. The context suggests a violent or aggressive situation, where the person in the cat is likely trying to attack the man.

Given the options, we need to find the one that best fits the action of a person trying to kill someone. 

- Accelerate (A) implies increasing speed, which doesn't directly relate to attacking someone.
- Putting together (B) implies assembling or joining, which is not relevant to the situation.
- Working (C) is a broad term that could mean many things, but it doesn't directly imply attacking someone.
- Construct (D) implies building or creating, which also doesn't fit the context of trying to kill someone.
- Train (E) implies guiding or directing, but in a violent context, it could also mean to prepare or instruct someone to attack.

However, none of these options perfectly fit the context. But if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him,"" we might think of actions that are more directly violent or aggressive. In this case, none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone.

But, if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him"" in a more general sense, we might think of actions that are more aggressive or violent. In this case, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if we had to choose from the given options, we might lean towards ""accelerate"" as a more aggressive action, although it's still a bit of a stretch.

However, since none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone, and considering the context of the question, I would say that the correct answer is not explicitly listed. But, for the sake of providing an answer, I would choose:

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The man is trying to escape in time, which means he is trying to get out of a situation as fast as possible. The cat is trying to kill him, which means the cat is trying to stop him from escaping. The word 'accelerate' means to increase speed, which is a logical action for the cat to take in order to catch the man. 'Putting together' and 'construct' are not actions that would be associated with the cat trying to kill the man. 'Working' is a general term that could apply to many things, but it is not a specific action that would be associated with the cat trying to kill the man. 'Train' is a verb that means to teach or instruct, which is not a logical action for the cat to take in this situation.

Headphones can become uncomfortable after wearing them for a long period, especially over-ear models."	" 

1. The question mentions speakers strapped on your ears, which implies a personal, portable device.
2. The term ""speakers"" is commonly associated with audio equipment, and when it's strapped to the ears, it's likely for personal listening.
3. The options provided include ""headphones,"" which are a common type of audio equipment designed for personal listening.
4. The other options, such as ""take it all in,"" ""desktop,"" ""conference,"" and ""concert,"" do not fit the context of the question.

Answer: B"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells of people having speakers strapped on their ears. The most common use of such speakers is to listen to music or audio while keeping the volume low. In this case 'headphones' makes sense since it is a device that is used to listen to audio while keeping the volume low. 'take it all in' is a phrase that means to listen carefully, but it is not a device. 'desktop' is a place where computers are usually placed, so it is not a device. 'conference' is a meeting, so it is not a device. 'concert' is a musical performance, so it is not a device.
