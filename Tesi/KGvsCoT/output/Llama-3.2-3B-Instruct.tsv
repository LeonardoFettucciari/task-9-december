2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	E	E	E	E	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	" 

The question mentions a man trying to break a glass to escape, but he fails. It also mentions a person in a cat trying to kill him. The context suggests a violent or aggressive situation, where the person in the cat is likely trying to attack the man.

Given the options, we need to find the one that best fits the action of a person trying to kill someone. 

- Accelerate (A) implies increasing speed, which doesn't directly relate to attacking someone.
- Putting together (B) implies assembling or joining, which is not relevant to the situation.
- Working (C) is a broad term that could mean many things, but it doesn't directly imply attacking someone.
- Construct (D) implies building or creating, which also doesn't fit the context of trying to kill someone.
- Train (E) implies guiding or directing, but in a violent context, it could also mean to prepare or instruct someone to attack.

However, none of these options perfectly fit the context. But if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him,"" we might think of actions that are more directly violent or aggressive. In this case, none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone.

But, if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him"" in a more general sense, we might think of actions that are more aggressive or violent. In this case, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if we had to choose from the given options, we might lean towards ""accelerate"" as a more aggressive action, although it's still a bit of a stretch.

However, since none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone, and considering the context of the question, I would say that the correct answer is not explicitly listed. But, for the sake of providing an answer, I would choose:

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. While'morning', 'before noon', 'before lunch' all come before afternoon so they don't make sense here. 'Christmas' is not relevant to the context of the question.

The question states that the man tried to reply to the woman, but he had difficulty keeping track of conversations. This implies that the man was involved in a conversation, but he struggled to follow or remember certain parts of it. The phrase ""that he didn't do"" suggests that the man was trying to recall or remember something he had done in the conversation.

The phrase ""initiate"" (A) means to start something, which doesn't fit the context of the man trying to remember what he did in the conversation. 

The phrase ""ignore"" (B) means to deliberately pay no attention to something, which also doesn't fit the context. 

The phrase ""ask"" (E) means to request information, which is the opposite of what the man was trying to do.

Feeling loved often involves receiving affection, attention, and care from others.
Words of encouragement and kind gestures can make someone feel loved.
Physical touch, like hugs or holding hands, can convey feelings of love and comfort."	" 

The question mentions a man giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets. The term 'pan handler' typically refers to someone who collects and recycles cans and bottles for a living. 

Given this context, the assistance the man is giving is likely financial or material in nature, as pan handlers often rely on donations or sales of their collected items to make a living.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A. feeling good - This doesn't directly relate to the act of giving assistance.
B. killing - This is the opposite of giving assistance and is not relevant to the context.
C. law suits - This doesn't make sense in the context of giving assistance to a pan handler.
D. out of pocket - This means giving money from one's own resources, which aligns with the idea of financial assistance.
E. feel loved - This is an emotional response and doesn't describe a method of giving assistance.

1. The question mentions ""blowfish,"" which is a type of fish. This immediately suggests that the correct answer should be related to a place where fish are sold or found.

2. The phrase ""get some"" implies that the people are looking to acquire blowfish, likely for consumption.

3. Considering the options, we can eliminate A (atlantic ocean) because it's a body of water, not a place to get fish. B (books) is unrelated to the context. C (france) is a country, not a place to get fish. D (aquarium) is a place where fish are kept, but it's not a place to get them.

4. This leaves us with E (fish market), which is a place where fish are sold, making it the most likely correct answer.

4f23829b96b38b5633ecc3325281726d	John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. What might he have bee on?	"A. mountain
B. fancy
C. sandplain
D. cliff
E. gorge"	D	C	C	A	E	E	E	"A cliff is a steep, vertical or nearly vertical rock face.
Cliffs are often found along coasts, mountains, or river valleys."	" 

The question mentions that John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean. This implies that the plain is a large, flat area of land. 

Now, let's examine the choices:

A. mountain - Mountains are typically not flat, so this doesn't fit the description of the plain.

B. fancy - This choice doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Fancy is an adjective used to describe something as elegant or luxurious, but it's not a type of land feature.

C. sandplain - A sandplain is a type of flat, low-lying area of land covered with sand. This fits the description of the plain mentioned in the question.

D. cliff - Cliffs are steep, rocky formations that drop off into a valley or ocean. This doesn't match the description of the plain.

E. gorge - A gorge is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. This also doesn't fit the description of the plain.

Based on the reasoning, the correct answer is:

Considering the options, ""A. scary"" doesn't fit because making friends shouldn't be scary for someone who is outgoing. ""B. having friends"" is also incorrect because it's the opposite of what the question is asking. ""C. good feeling"" is a possible interpretation, but it's not the most fitting answer. ""D. conflict"" is also not the best choice because it implies a negative aspect, which doesn't align with the idea of making friends being no personal issue. 

The most suitable answer is ""E. friendship"" because it's the thing that he's making, and the phrase ""no personal what"" suggests that the act of making friends is not a concern or a problem for him.

Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. While'morning', 'before noon', 'before lunch' all come before afternoon so they don't make sense here.

Suburbs are often seen as desirable places to raise children due to the safer, less hectic environment.
A strong sense of community can make a neighborhood feel safe and welcoming.
A neighborhood watch program can help increase safety by encouraging residents to look out for each other."	" The question mentions that the children loved having a backyard, and the parents loved that it was a safe area. This implies that the backyard is a secure location for the children to play. The term 'backyard' is already given, so we need to find the word that best completes the sentence in a way that emphasizes its safety.

Option A,'suburb', refers to a type of residential area, but it doesn't directly relate to the safety of the backyard. Option B, 'neighborhood', is also a type of residential area and doesn't specifically emphasize safety. Option D, 'roundabout', is a type of traffic circle and doesn't fit the context of the sentence.

Between options C, 'back of house', and E, 'property', 'back of house' is a more accurate and idiomatic expression that completes the sentence. It emphasizes the location of the backyard in relation to the house, which is a common way to describe a backyard. 'Property' is a broader term that could refer to any area of land, but it doesn't specifically convey the idea of safety.

D. city - A city is a large area with many buildings, including offices. So, it's unlikely to have only a few offices.

E. work - ""Work"" is a general term that refers to the activity of doing a job, but it's not a specific location. So, it's not a suitable answer.

An afterword is a section in a book that appears at the end, typically written by the author or another contributor.

A foreword is an introduction to a book, often written by someone other than the author. It's usually found at the beginning of the book. 

The question asks what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword. This means we're looking for something that is not an introduction to the book.

Option A, ""last word,"" is not necessarily related to the content of the book itself, but rather a phrase that could be found at the end of a chapter or section.

Option B, ""conclusion,"" is a term often used in academic or formal writing to describe the final part of a chapter or section, but it's not a specific term for a section that is not a foreword.

Option C, ""ikea instructions,"" is unrelated to the content of a book and seems out of place in this context.

Option D, ""afterword,"" is a section that is often found at the end of a book, but it's not an introduction. An afterword is usually written by the author and provides additional information or insights after the main content of the book.

Option E, ""epilogue,"" is a section that is often found at the end of a book, but it's not an introduction. An epilogue is usually a short section that provides additional information or context after the main content of the book.

Considering the options, the most likely thing to be found in a book that is not a foreword is an ""afterword"" or an ""epilogue."" However, since the question asks for a single answer, we'll choose the one that is more commonly associated with the end of a book.

Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of people having so much fun in the afternoon that they thought something happened in a really fast way than usual. Having fun is usually associated with the fast passing of time. Since they had fun in the afternoon, what comes after the afternoon may have happened in a really fast way. In such case 'evening' makes sense since it comes after afternoon. While'morning', 'before noon', 'before lunch' all come before afternoon so they don't make sense here. 'Christmas' is not relevant to the context of the question.
