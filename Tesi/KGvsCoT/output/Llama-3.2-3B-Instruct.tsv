2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	A	A	E	E	A	E	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	" 

The question mentions a man trying to break a glass to escape, but he fails. It also mentions a person in a cat trying to kill him. The context suggests a violent or aggressive situation, where the person in the cat is likely trying to attack the man.

Given the options, we need to find the one that best fits the action of a person trying to kill someone. 

- Accelerate (A) implies increasing speed, which doesn't directly relate to attacking someone.
- Putting together (B) implies assembling or joining, which is not relevant to the situation.
- Working (C) is a broad term that could mean many things, but it doesn't directly imply attacking someone.
- Construct (D) implies building or creating, which also doesn't fit the context of trying to kill someone.
- Train (E) implies guiding or directing, but in a violent context, it could also mean to prepare or instruct someone to attack.

However, none of these options perfectly fit the context. But if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him,"" we might think of actions that are more directly violent or aggressive. In this case, none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone.

But, if we consider the phrase ""trying to kill him"" in a more general sense, we might think of actions that are more aggressive or violent. In this case, the correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if we had to choose from the given options, we might lean towards ""accelerate"" as a more aggressive action, although it's still a bit of a stretch.

However, since none of the options directly match the action of trying to kill someone, and considering the context of the question, I would say that the correct answer is not explicitly listed. But, for the sake of providing an answer, I would choose:

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The man is trying to escape in time, which means he is trying to get out of a situation as fast as possible. The cat is trying to kill him, which means the cat is trying to stop him from escaping. The word 'accelerate' means to increase speed, which is a logical action for the cat to take in order to catch the man. 'Putting together' and 'construct' are not actions that would be associated with the cat trying to kill the man. 'Working' is a general term that could apply to many things, but it is not a specific action that would be associated with the cat trying to kill the man. 'Train' is a verb that means to teach or instruct, which is not a logical action for the cat to take in this situation.

The question states that the man tried to reply to the woman, but he had difficulty keeping track of conversations. This implies that the man was involved in a conversation, but he struggled to follow or remember certain parts of it. The phrase ""that he didn't do"" suggests that the man was trying to recall or remember something he had done in the conversation.

Considering the options, we can eliminate ""question"" (C) because the man was trying to reply, not ask a question. We can also eliminate ""answer"" (D) because the man was trying to reply, not respond to a question. 

The phrase ""initiate"" (A) means to start something, which doesn't fit the context of the man trying to remember what he did in the conversation. 

The phrase ""ignore"" (B) means to deliberately pay no attention to something, which also doesn't fit the context. 

The phrase ""ask"" (E) means to request information, which is the opposite of what the man was trying to do.

d0bda97a087904320216e4d0b8a08a8d	The man was giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets, how did he give assistance?	"A. feeling good
B. killing
C. law suits
D. out of pocket
E. feel loved"	D	D	D	E	A	A	E		" 

The question mentions a man giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets. The term 'pan handler' typically refers to someone who collects and recycles cans and bottles for a living. 

Given this context, the assistance the man is giving is likely financial or material in nature, as pan handlers often rely on donations or sales of their collected items to make a living.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A. feeling good - This doesn't directly relate to the act of giving assistance.
B. killing - This is the opposite of giving assistance and is not relevant to the context.
C. law suits - This doesn't make sense in the context of giving assistance to a pan handler.
D. out of pocket - This means giving money from one's own resources, which aligns with the idea of financial assistance.
E. feel loved - This is an emotional response and doesn't describe a method of giving assistance.

Considering these points, the most suitable answer is:

Answer: D"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  'Feeling good' and 'feel loved' are emotions, so they don't make sense in the context of giving assistance. 'Killing' is the opposite of giving assistance, so it is not a valid option. 'Law suits' is a legal action, so it is not a valid option. 'Out of pocket' is a phrase that can be used to describe giving money, but in this context, it is not the most likely way to give assistance to a pan handler. Pan handlers are people who ask for money on the street, so the most likely way to give assistance is to give money.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. Chest of drawers - Typically, drawers in a chest of drawers are visible, so this doesn't fit the description.

B. Stove - A stove usually has shelves or racks for storing cookware, but these are usually visible, so this doesn't fit the description.

C. Hold alcohol - This option is vague, but it's possible that a storage unit for holding alcohol could have a shelf that conceals its contents. However, this is not a common object.

D. Bookcase - A bookcase often has shelves, but these shelves are usually designed to be visible, allowing you to see the books on them. However, some bookcases have closed or hidden shelves, which could fit the description.

E. eat cake"	C	C	C	E	C	C	E	"Outer space is mostly empty, but it contains stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and galaxies.
Stars in outer space are incredibly far apart, which is why the night sky looks like a vast expanse of blackness."	" 

First, we need to understand the context of the question, which is about traveling to a star. 

Next, we consider the options given. 

- A. night sky: This is the area we can see stars in, but it's not a place to travel to a star.
- B. galaxy: A galaxy is a large collection of stars, but it's not a destination for traveling to a specific star.
- C. outer space: This is the vast area that includes stars, planets, and galaxies. It's the most likely place to travel to a star.
- D. Hollywood: This is a famous film production center and has no connection to traveling to stars.
- E. eat cake: This option seems unrelated to traveling to a star.

Considering the options, the most logical choice for traveling to a star is outer space.

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  To 'travel to a star' means to go to a celestial body, which is a star. 'Hollywood' is a place on earth, so it is not a valid option. 'Eat cake' is a food, so it is not a valid option. 'Galaxy' is a celestial body, but it is a collection of stars, so it is not the destination of a single star. 'Night sky' is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, so it is not the destination of a single star. 'Outer space' is the general term for the celestial bodies, so it is not the destination of a single star. However, 'outer space' is the general term for the celestial bodies, and 'night sky' is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, so 'night sky' is the most likely answer since it is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, and a star is a celestial body.

Answer:
A"	 C	 C	" 

First, we need to understand the context of the question, which is about traveling to a star. 

Next, we consider the options given. 

- A. night sky: This is the area we can see stars in, but it's not a place to travel to a star.
- B. galaxy: A galaxy is a large collection of stars, but it's not a destination for traveling to a specific star.
- C. outer space: This is the vast area that includes stars, planets, and galaxies. It's the most likely place to travel to a star.
- D. Hollywood: This is a famous film production center and has no connection to traveling to stars.
- E. eat cake: This option seems unrelated to traveling to a star.

Considering the options, the most logical choice for traveling to a star is outer space.

Answer: C"	 C	 C	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  To 'travel to a star' means to go to a celestial body, which is a star. 'Hollywood' is a place on earth, so it is not a valid option. 'Eat cake' is a food, so it is not a valid option. 'Galaxy' is a celestial body, but it is a collection of stars, so it is not the destination of a single star. 'Night sky' is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, so it is not the destination of a single star. 'Outer space' is the general term for the celestial bodies, so it is not the destination of a single star. However, 'outer space' is the general term for the celestial bodies, and 'night sky' is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, so 'night sky' is the most likely answer since it is the view of the celestial bodies in the sky, and a star is a celestial body.

The question asks for the opposite of ""a little"" of something. ""A little"" implies a small amount, so we need to find the word that represents the opposite of that. 

Option A, ""much"", is the correct answer because it generally means a large or considerable amount, which is the opposite of ""a little"". 

Answer: A"	" 
The question asks for the opposite of 'a little of something'. The opposite of 'a little' is 'a lot'. 'A lot' is the antonym of 'a little'. 'Much' and 'plenty' are synonyms of 'a lot', so they are not the opposite. 'More' is also a synonym of 'a lot', so it is not the opposite. 'Big' is a general term that can be used to describe something, but it is not the opposite of 'a little'.

1. Jane works for the government as a senator. This implies she is involved in the legislative process, which is typically centered in the capital city of the country.

2. The term ""senator"" specifically refers to a member of the U.S. Senate, which is the upper house of the U.S. Congress.

3. Given that Jane is a senator, it is logical to conclude that she spends a lot of time in the location that serves as the capital of the United States.

Considering these points, the most likely place Jane spends a lot of time is the capital of the United States.

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that Jane works for the government as a senator. A senator is a government official, and government officials usually work in the government's headquarters. The headquarters of the US government is in Washington D.C. Therefore, it is likely that Jane spends a lot of time in Washington D.C. 'Capitol building' is a part of the government's headquarters, but it is not the whole place. 'Everything' is not a valid option since it is too broad. 'Russia' and 'Canada' are not the headquarters of the US government, so they are not valid options.

1. The question mentions that Bob the lizard lives in a warm place. This suggests that the environment is suitable for a lizard, which typically thrives in warm temperatures.

2. It also mentions that Bob lives in a place with lots of water. This implies that the environment is aquatic or has access to water sources.

3. Considering these two points, we can narrow down the options. Options A (rock) and E (rocky places) do not necessarily imply a warm environment with lots of water. Option C (jazz club) is unlikely to be a natural habitat for a lizard. Option D (New Mexico) is a state in the United States with varying climates, but it's not typically known for being warm and having lots of water.

4. This leaves us with option B (tropical rainforest), which is a warm and humid environment with abundant water sources, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. This makes it the most likely habitat for Bob the lizard.

First, we need to understand the context of the question. It's asking for a location where you wouldn't want to find mice. 

Next, we can analyze each option:

- Loft (A) and attic (B) are typically found in houses and are known to be places where mice often live due to their proximity to food sources and shelter.
- Bell cat (C) is a type of cat, not a location.
- Countryside (D) is a rural area, which might be a place where mice can be found, especially in fields or barns.
- Laboratory (E) is a place where scientists conduct experiments, and it's less likely to have mice as they are typically kept in controlled environments.

'die' is a possible consequence, but it is not the most likely one, since the question is about what one would receive, not what would happen to one.

In some fish markets, you can find live fish that are sold on the spot.
Fish are often displayed on ice in fish markets to keep them fresh.
Many fish markets have a variety of seafood, including exotic or hard-to-find species for those looking for something special."	" 

1. The question mentions ""blowfish,"" which is a type of fish. This immediately suggests that the correct answer should be related to a place where fish are sold or found.

2. The phrase ""get some"" implies that the people are looking to acquire blowfish, likely for consumption.

3. Considering the options, we can eliminate A (atlantic ocean) because it's a body of water, not a place to get fish. B (books) is unrelated to the context. C (france) is a country, not a place to get fish. D (aquarium) is a place where fish are kept, but it's not a place to get them.

4f23829b96b38b5633ecc3325281726d	John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. What might he have bee on?	"A. mountain
B. fancy
C. sandplain
D. cliff
E. gorge"	D	C	C	A	C	C	E	"A cliff is a steep, vertical or nearly vertical rock face.
Cliffs are often found along coasts, mountains, or river valleys."	" 

The question mentions that John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean. This implies that the plain is a large, flat area of land. 

Now, let's examine the choices:

A. mountain - Mountains are typically not flat, so this doesn't fit the description of the plain.

B. fancy - This choice doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Fancy is an adjective used to describe something as elegant or luxurious, but it's not a type of land feature.

C. sandplain - A sandplain is a type of flat, low-lying area of land covered with sand. This fits the description of the plain mentioned in the question.

D. cliff - Cliffs are steep, rocky formations that drop off into a valley or ocean. This doesn't match the description of the plain.

E. gorge - A gorge is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. This also doesn't fit the description of the plain.

Based on the reasoning, the correct answer is:

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that John rode something until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. The word 'plain' is used here, which is a flat area of land. The word 'plain' is also used to describe a type of landscape. Since John rode something until it reached the ocean, the object he rode must be something that can be ridden and is flat. 'Mountain' is not a flat object, so it is not a valid option. 'Fancy' is not a type of landscape, so it is not a valid option. 'Cliff' is a steep slope, so it is not a valid option. 'Gorge' is a deep, narrow valley, so it is not a valid option. 'Sandplain' is a type of flat area of land, so it is a valid option.

People can feel confused when they don't understand instructions or when things are not explained properly."	" The question states that Zane doesn't like answering questions, and it's because he's not good at it. This implies that his inability to answer questions is due to a specific issue. 

Option A, panic, is a plausible reason because if Zane panics when answering questions, he might freeze or struggle to respond, making it difficult for him to answer correctly. 

Option B, discussion, doesn't make sense in this context because it's not an issue that would prevent someone from answering questions. 

Option C, attention, could be a factor, but it's not directly related to the inability to answer questions. 

Option D, confusion, might be a temporary issue, but it's not a long-term problem that would prevent Zane from answering questions. 

Option E, satisfaction, is the opposite of what we're looking for because if Zane is not satisfied with answering questions, it wouldn't explain why he's not good at it.

1. The sentence ""James couldn't get comfortable"" implies that James is having trouble relaxing or feeling at ease, which is often due to an uncomfortable environment.

2. The phrase ""There was too much dirt"" suggests that the issue is related to dirt or filth, which is likely affecting James' comfort.

3. Considering the context, the most plausible location where James would encounter dirt and be uncomfortable is in a place where he would typically sit or lie down.

4. Among the given options, the one that best fits this scenario is a place where James would likely sit or lie down, and where dirt could be a significant issue.

5. The correct answer is the one that is most closely related to a place where James would be sitting or lying down, and where dirt could be a problem.

'Ground' is a general term that could refer to many places, but it is not specific enough.

Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells of James not being able to get comfortable because there was too much dirt. This implies that the dirt is in a place where James is trying to rest or sleep. The only option that makes sense in this context is 'bed', since it is a place where one rests and sleeps, and it is likely that the dirt is in the bed itself. 'Ground' is a general term that could refer to many places, but it is not specific enough. 'Subway' and 'bank' are places where one would not typically find dirt, and'street' is a place where dirt is more likely to be found, but it is not the most likely place for James to be trying to get comfortable.

B. having friends
C. good feeling
D. conflict
E. friendship"	D	C	C	E	A	A	E		" The question states that ""He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?"" This implies that the word we're looking for is something that is not a personal issue for him when it comes to making friends. 

Outgoing people are often described as being confident and sociable. The phrase ""no personal what"" suggests that the word we're looking for is something that is not a concern or a problem for him. 

Considering the options, ""A. scary"" doesn't fit because making friends shouldn't be scary for someone who is outgoing. ""B. having friends"" is also incorrect because it's the opposite of what the question is asking. ""C. good feeling"" is a possible interpretation, but it's not the most fitting answer. ""D. conflict"" is also not the best choice because it implies a negative aspect, which doesn't align with the idea of making friends being no personal issue. 

The most suitable answer is ""E. friendship"" because it's the thing that he's making, and the phrase ""no personal what"" suggests that the act of making friends is not a concern or a problem for him. 

Answer: E"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step. The question tells of someone who is very outgoing and making friends is no big deal for him. This means that making friends is something that he does easily and naturally, without any difficulties. The word 'no personal' suggests that the difficulty or challenge is not related to him, but rather to the act of making friends. Therefore, the correct answer is'scary', since making friends can be a scary experience for many people, but not for someone who is very outgoing.

C. back of house
D. roundabout
E. property"	B	C	C	A	C	B	E	"A strong sense of community can make a neighborhood feel safe and welcoming.
A neighborhood watch program can help increase safety by encouraging residents to look out for each other."	" The question mentions that the children loved having a backyard, and the parents loved that it was a safe area. This implies that the backyard is a secure location for the children to play. The term 'backyard' is already given, so we need to find the word that best completes the sentence in a way that emphasizes its safety.

Option A,'suburb', refers to a type of residential area, but it doesn't directly relate to the safety of the backyard. Option B, 'neighborhood', is also a type of residential area and doesn't specifically emphasize safety. Option D, 'roundabout', is a type of traffic circle and doesn't fit the context of the sentence.

Between options C, 'back of house', and E, 'property', 'back of house' is a more accurate and idiomatic expression that completes the sentence. It emphasizes the location of the backyard in relation to the house, which is a common way to describe a backyard. 'Property' is a broader term that could refer to any area of land, but it doesn't specifically convey the idea of safety.

Answer: C"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells of children loving having a back yard, and parents loving that it was a safe place. The word 'back' is used twice, which suggests that the safe place is in the back of something. The most likely thing that would have a 'back' is a house.

To change their lives, people typically need to make some form of self-improvement or take steps towards a desired goal. This involves reflecting on their current situation, identifying areas for improvement, and making conscious decisions to alter their circumstances.

Option A, ""face problems,"" doesn't necessarily imply a proactive approach to change. It could mean confronting issues, but it doesn't necessarily mean taking steps to resolve them.

Option C, ""pay bills,"" is a necessary task for maintaining daily life but doesn't directly contribute to changing one's life.

Option D, ""become disillusioned,"" is actually the opposite of what's needed to change one's life. Disillusionment often leads to a lack of motivation and direction.

Option E, ""eat chicken,"" is unrelated to changing one's life. It's a specific action that doesn't contribute to personal growth or improvement.

Option B, ""better themselves,"" is the most suitable choice. It implies a desire to improve and grow, which is a fundamental aspect of changing one's life.

Let's reason step-by-step.  To 'face problems' is to confront them, but it is not the same as changing one's life.

First, we need to understand what an ""office"" is. An office is typically a place where people work, usually in a building or a room.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

B. new york - New York is a city, not a building. So, it can't have offices.

C. school building - A school building is typically used for education, not for offices. So, it's unlikely to have offices.

D. city - A city is a large area with many buildings, including offices. So, it's unlikely to have only a few offices.

E. work - ""Work"" is a general term that refers to the activity of doing a job, but it's not a specific location. So, it's not a suitable answer.

Now, let's think about where you might find only a few offices. A small town or a village might have only a few offices, as they are smaller and less densely populated.

A foreword is an introduction to a book, often written by someone other than the author. It's usually found at the beginning of the book. 

The question asks what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword. This means we're looking for something that is not an introduction to the book.

Option A, ""last word,"" is not necessarily related to the content of the book itself, but rather a phrase that could be found at the end of a chapter or section.

Option B, ""conclusion,"" is a term often used in academic or formal writing to describe the final part of a chapter or section, but it's not a specific term for a section that is not a foreword.

Option C, ""ikea instructions,"" is unrelated to the content of a book and seems out of place in this context.

Option D, ""afterword,"" is a section that is often found at the end of a book, but it's not an introduction. An afterword is usually written by the author and provides additional information or insights after the main content of the book.

Option E, ""epilogue,"" is a section that is often found at the end of a book, but it's not an introduction. An epilogue is usually a short section that provides additional information or context after the main content of the book.

Considering the options, the most likely thing to be found in a book that is not a foreword is an ""afterword"" or an ""epilogue."" However, since the question asks for a single answer, we'll choose the one that is more commonly associated with the end of a book.

B. bathroom
C. michigan
D. minnesota
E. painting"	E	B	E	E	A	E	A	The purpose of a painting can vary, from expressing emotions to capturing scenes or telling stories.	" 

1. Grapes are typically grown in fields for consumption or production of wine, juice, etc.
2. The context of the question implies that the grape is being fed to someone else, which suggests a social or domestic setting.
3. Considering the options, a field (A) is unlikely to be a social setting where someone is being fed grapes.
4. A bathroom (B) is also an unlikely setting for feeding someone grapes, as it's not a typical place for food consumption.
5. Michigan (C) and Minnesota (D) are states, which don't directly relate to the context of the question.
6. A painting (E) is an artistic creation, and it's highly unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in this context.

Given the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the grape is being fed to someone else in a field, but since that's not an option, we can eliminate the other options. However, the question itself seems to be flawed, as it's unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in a field. 

If we consider the intent of the question might be to find a place where grapes are typically fed to someone else, we can infer that the correct answer is likely a domestic setting, such as a kitchen or dining table. However, this is not among the provided options.

Since the question itself is flawed, I will choose the closest plausible answer based on the context:

Answer: A"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  A grape is a type of fruit, and it is unlikely to be fed to someone else in a field, since fields are places where crops are grown, not where food is served. 'Bathroom' is also not a likely place, since it is a place for personal hygiene, not for serving food. 'Michigan' and 'Minnesota' are states, so they are not likely places either. 'Painting' is a creative activity, and it is unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in this context. However, grapes are often used to make wine, and wine is often served to people, so a grape is likely to be being fed to someone else in a place where wine is being served, which is not listed among the options. However, the most likely place is a 'bar' or a'restaurant', but since this is not listed, the best option is 'painting' is not correct, but 'field' is not correct, since grapes are not typically fed to people in fields. However, the best option is 'painting' is not correct, but 'field' is not correct, since grapes are not typically fed to people in fields. However, the best option is 'painting' is not correct, but 'field' is not correct, since grapes are not typically fed to people in fields.

1. Grapes are typically grown in fields for consumption or production of wine, juice, etc.
2. The context of the question implies that the grape is being fed to someone else, which suggests a social or domestic setting.
3. Considering the options, a field (A) is unlikely to be a social setting where someone is being fed grapes.
4. A bathroom (B) is also an unlikely setting for feeding someone grapes, as it's not a typical place for food consumption.
5. Michigan (C) and Minnesota (D) are states, which don't directly relate to the context of the question.
6. A painting (E) is an artistic creation, and it's highly unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in this context.

Given the reasoning, the most plausible answer is that the grape is being fed to someone else in a field, but since that's not an option, we can eliminate the other options. However, the question itself seems to be flawed, as it's unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in a field. 

If we consider the intent of the question might be to find a place where grapes are typically fed to someone else, we can infer that the correct answer is likely a domestic setting, such as a kitchen or dining table. However, this is not among the provided options.

Since the question itself is flawed, I will choose the closest plausible answer based on the context:

Answer: A"	 A	 E	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  A grape is a type of fruit, and it is unlikely to be fed to someone else in a field, since fields are places where crops are grown, not where food is served. 'Bathroom' is also not a likely place, since it is a place for personal hygiene, not for serving food. 'Michigan' and 'Minnesota' are states, so they are not likely places either. 'Painting' is a creative activity, and it is unlikely that a grape would be fed to someone else in this context. However, grapes are often used to make wine, and wine is often served to people, so a grape is likely to be being fed to someone else in a place where wine is being served, which is not listed among the options. However, the most likely place is a 'bar' or a'restaurant', but since this is not listed, the best option is 'painting' is not correct, but 'field' is not correct, since grapes are not typically fed to people in fields.

1. The question mentions a ""holy site,"" which implies a place of great spiritual significance. 
2. The context suggests that the emotions of the people are related to this site.
3. The phrase ""this was what"" implies that the emotions are a result of something specific.
4. The options provided include words that describe the nature or state of something, but none directly relate to the emotions or the context of a holy site.
5. However, we can infer that the correct answer is related to the emotions of the people. 
6. Among the options, ""common"" is the one that could be related to the emotions of the people. It implies that the emotions are a normal or expected response to a situation, which is plausible in the context of a holy site.

Answer: D"	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells of people crying at a holy site. A holy site is a place of great spiritual significance, often associated with religious or cultural events. The fact that people are crying at such a place suggests that they are overcome with emotion, likely due to the significance of the site. The correct answer should be something that would evoke strong emotions, especially in a place of great spiritual significance. 'Profane' means not sacred or holy, which is the opposite of what is expected at a holy site. 'Halibut' is a type of fish, which is unrelated to the context of the question. 'Damaged' implies something that is broken or harmed, which doesn't fit the context of people crying at a holy site. 'Common' means ordinary or usual, which doesn't evoke the same level of emotion as the other options. 'Halibut' is repeated, which is likely a mistake.
