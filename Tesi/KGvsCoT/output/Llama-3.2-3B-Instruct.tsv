It also mentions a person in a cat trying to kill him. The context suggests a cat is being used as a vehicle or a means to attack the man. 

Given this context, the most logical action the person in the cat would take to kill the man is to ""accelerate"" - to move faster, which would increase the chances of hitting the man. This action is consistent with the cat being used as a means to attack the man."	Let's reason step-by-step.  The man is trying to escape in time, which means he is trying to get out of a situation as fast as possible. The cat is trying to kill him, which means the cat is trying to stop him from escaping. The word 'accelerate' means to increase speed, which is a logical action for the cat to take in order to catch the man. 'Putting together' and 'construct' are not actions that would help the cat catch the man. 'Working' is a general term that could apply to many things, but it is not a specific action that would help the cat catch the man. 'Train' is a verb that means to teach or instruct, which is not relevant to the situation.	 A	 A	"

B. killing
C. law suits
D. out of pocket
E. feel loved"	D	D	D	D	A	A	D			Let's reason step-by-step.  'Feeling good' and 'feel loved' are emotions, so they don't make sense in the context of giving assistance. 'Killing' is the opposite of giving assistance, so it is not a valid option. 'Law suits' is a legal action, so it is not a valid option. 'Out of pocket' is a phrase that can be used to describe giving money, but in this context, the man is giving assistance, not money. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the man gave assistance by 'giving assistance' to the pan handler, but since that is not an option, we can infer that the man gave assistance by 'giving aid' or 'helping', but that is not an option either. However, 'out of pocket' is a phrase that can be used to describe giving money, but in this context, the man is giving assistance, not money. The phrase 'out of pocket' can also be used to describe giving aid or help, so it is the most likely answer.	 D	 D	" 

The question mentions a man giving assistance to a pan handler in the streets. The term ""pan handler"" typically refers to someone who collects and recycles cans and bottles for a living. 

Given this context, the assistance the man is giving is likely financial or material in nature, as pan handlers often rely on donations or sales of their collected items to make a living. 

Options A, B, C, and E do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to providing assistance or support to someone in need financially or practically. 

Option D, ""out of pocket,"" implies giving money or resources from one's own funds, which aligns with the idea of providing assistance to a pan handler. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: Answer: D"	 A	 A	" 
Let's reason step-by-step.  'Feeling good' and 'feel loved' are emotions, so they don't make sense in the context of giving assistance. 'Killing' is the opposite of giving assistance, so it is not a valid option. 'Law suits' is a legal action, so it is not a valid option.

Let's reason step-by-step.  The question tells us that Jane works for the government as a senator. A senator is a government official, and government officials usually work in the government's headquarters. The headquarters of the US government is in Washington D.C. Therefore, it is likely that Jane spends a lot of time in Washington D.C. 'Capitol building' is a part of the government's headquarters, but it is not the whole place. 'Everything' is not a valid option since it is too broad. 'Russia' and 'Canada' are not the headquarters of the US government, so they are not valid options.

"The question mentions that she wanted to get in shape, which implies that she is trying to improve her physical health. The phrase ""but she couldn't stay focused"" suggests that the activity she is trying to do is something that requires sustained attention and effort. 

Given these clues, we can eliminate options A (sweating) and E (swim) because sweating is a byproduct of exercise, and swimming is a type of exercise itself. We can also eliminate option B (exercise) because it's a broad term that encompasses many activities, and option C (work out) is a synonym for exercise.

This leaves us with option D (video), which is a plausible answer because many people try to stay focused on a video workout, which can be an hour long.

The question tells of John riding something until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. The word 'plain' is used here, which is a flat area of land. Since John couldn't go any farther, it means that the plain must have reached the ocean, which is a body of water. Therefore, John must have been on a'sandplain', which is a flat area of land made of sand, and is likely to reach the ocean. 'Mountain' is a high landform, 'fancy' is not a geographical term, 'cliff' is a steep slope, and 'gorge' is a deep, narrow valley, none of which would be likely to be reached by a plain.	 C	 C	"

'Friendship' is also not a correct answer since the question is asking what making friends is 'no personal' to him, not what he has.	 C	 C	" The question states that ""He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?"" The word ""personal"" is being used to contrast with ""outgoing."" Outgoing people are often described as being very social and friendly. The phrase ""for him making friends was no personal what?"" implies that making friends is not a problem or a challenge for him. Therefore, the correct answer should be something that is not a challenge or a problem for someone who is outgoing.

The correct answer is D. conflict. Making friends is not a conflict for someone who is outgoing, as they are likely to have an easy time meeting new people and forming relationships."	 A	 A	"

D. afterword
E. epilogue"	E	B	E		E	E	D	An epilogue is often included at the end of a book, play, or movie.		Let's reason step-by-step.  A foreword is a section in a book that is written by someone other than the author, and it is usually placed at the beginning of the book. The question asks what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword. Since a foreword is at the beginning, what comes after it is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword. 'Ikea instructions' is not a typical content of a book, so it is not a likely candidate. 'Conclusion' is a section that comes after the main content of a book, so it is a possible candidate.

A foreword is an introductory section in a book, often written by someone other than the author. It provides background information or context about the book. 

The question asks what is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword. This means we are looking for something that is typically found after the main content of the book.

Option A, ""last word,"" is not a section or a part of a book, so it's unlikely to be found in a book.

Option B, ""conclusion,"" is a section that summarizes the main points of the book, but it's not typically found after the main content. It's usually the last section of the book.

Option C, ""ikea instructions,"" is unrelated to the context of a book, so it's unlikely to be found in a book.

Option D, ""afterword,"" is a section that is typically found after the main content of a book, providing additional information or context. However, it's not the correct answer because the question asks for something that is not a foreword.

Option E, ""epilogue,"" is a section that is typically found after the main content of a book, providing additional information or context. It's often used to provide a conclusion or a final thought, and it's not a foreword.
