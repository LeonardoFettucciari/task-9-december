In a social setting, someone might be labeled a ""loser"" if they don't fit in, are socially awkward, or lack the traits valued by the group.
In many cultures, peasants were considered part of the lower social class, with limited access to education or resources.
If something is considered inferior, it is often viewed as lower in quality compared to something else.
In a hierarchy, an inferior position may be one with less authority or fewer responsibilities.
The term ""plebeian"" originally referred to the common people in ancient Rome, distinct from the aristocratic patricians."	" The noble citizen was likely proud of their high social standing.
