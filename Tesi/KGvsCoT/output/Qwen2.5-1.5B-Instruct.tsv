Cliffs are often found along coasts, mountains, or river valleys."	"1) John rode on the plain initially.
2) The plain reaches the ocean.
3) He can't ride anymore because it ends at the ocean.

Now let's analyze each option:

A. Mountain - Mountains typically rise above plains but don't end abruptly like oceans do.
B. Fancy - This is not related to geography or terrain.
C. Sandplain - A sandplain is a flat area covered with sand, which doesn't fit the description of ending at an ocean.
D. Cliff - Cliffs often form where mountains meet oceans, creating abrupt drops that could be described as ""reaching"" the ocean.
E. Gorge - Gorges are deep valleys between cliffs, also fitting the idea of reaching the ocean.

Given these analyses, both D (cliff) and E (gorge) seem plausible based on the information provided. However, since we're looking for what he was likely riding on before reaching the ocean, the most logical choice would be the one that fits his previous mode of transportation more closely."	John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. A plain is a flat area of land without trees or buildings. It is often found between mountains or near rivers. When someone rides on a plain, they are traveling over open ground. The plain ends where there is water, which is the ocean. Therefore, John was probably riding on a plain until it reached the ocean, and then he could no longer ride further because the plain ended at the ocean.	 C	 D	"1) John rode on the plain initially.
2) The plain reaches the ocean.
3) He can't ride anymore because it ends at the ocean.

Now let's analyze each option:

A. Mountain - Mountains typically rise above plains but don't end abruptly like oceans do.
B. Fancy - This is not related to geography or terrain.
C. Sandplain - A sandplain is a flat area covered with sand, which doesn't fit the description of ending at an ocean.
D. Cliff - Cliffs often form where mountains meet oceans, creating abrupt drops that could be described as ""reaching"" the ocean.
E. Gorge - Gorges are deep valleys between cliffs, also fitting the idea of reaching the ocean.

Given these analyses, both D (cliff) and E (gorge) seem plausible based on the information provided. However, since we're looking for what he was likely riding on before reaching the ocean, the most logical choice would be the one that fits his previous mode of transportation more closely.

Answer: C"	 C	 C	" John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. A plain is a flat area of land without trees or buildings.
