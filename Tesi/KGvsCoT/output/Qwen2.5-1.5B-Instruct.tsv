2f85d53721ccc8b3fa4cfc184186d124	The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?	"A. accelerate
B. putting together
C. working
D. construct
E. train"	A	B	A	D	B	A	D	When you press the gas pedal in a car, the vehicle accelerates.	"1) The man was trying to escape from someone who wanted to kill him.
2) He broke the glass to try to escape.
3) But he couldn't do it.
4) So, we need to find out what the other person (the cat) did.

Now let's look at our options:

A. Accelerate - This doesn't fit because the cat wasn't accelerating; it was trying to kill the man.
B. Putting together - This is about making things, which isn't relevant here.
C. Working - This could mean doing something, but it's too vague.
D. Construct - This means building or creating something, which fits well with killing someone.
E. Train - This means teaching how to do something, which again isn't relevant.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. construct.

Answer: D"	" The sentence states that ""the man tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time"". This implies that the man was attempting to escape by breaking the glass. The next part of the sentence mentions someone who was trying to kill the man, and asks what action this person took. 

Given that the man was trying to escape by breaking the glass, it stands to reason that the person trying to kill him would try to prevent him from doing so. Therefore, the logical action taken by the person trying to kill the man would be to ""accelerate"" in order to hinder the man's attempt to break the glass.
